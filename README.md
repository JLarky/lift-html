# lift-html

lift-html is a tiny library for building HTML Web Components, components that
are meant to enhance existing HTML on the page instead of rendering it on the
client or hydrating it. It utilizes SolidJS to make attributes reactive, uses
signals for state management and uses hooks to better manipulate the DOM.

Code for `liftHtml` is public domain, so you are free to skip the dependency and
copy the code into your project. Do that if:

- you don't want to add another npm/jsr dependency
- you want to remove the parts of the code you don't need
- you want to quickly modify the code for your project or even a single
  component
