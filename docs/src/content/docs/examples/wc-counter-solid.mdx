import SolidCounter from "../../../components/examples/wc-counter-solid/SolidCounter.astro";

<SolidCounter />

# Code

#### Server markup


import SolidCounterText from "/src/components/examples/wc-counter-solid/SolidCounter.astro?raw";

<Code code={SolidCounterText} lang="astro" title='SolidCounter.astro' />

#### Client implementation

import SolidCounterTsText from "/src/components/examples/wc-counter-solid/wc-counter-solid.ts?raw";

<Code code={SolidCounterTsText} lang="ts" title='wc-counter-solid.ts' />

## Explanation

While I personally dont't use Shadow DOM you are welcome to do so. In this example you can see that CSS is scoped to the component and even rules like `* { font-size: 200%; }` do not leak outside of the component.

You can also see that the markup that server returns is initially empty that causes a layout shift when the page is (re)loaded.
