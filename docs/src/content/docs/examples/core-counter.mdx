import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Counter from "../../../components/examples/core-counter/CoreCounter.astro";

<Counter />

# Code

#### Server markup

import CounterText from "/src/components/examples/core-counter/CoreCounter.astro?raw";

<Code code={CounterText} lang="astro" title='CoreCounter.astro' />

([source](https://github.com/JLarky/lift-html/tree/main/docs/src/components/examples/core-counter/CoreCounter.astro))

#### Client implementation

import CounterTsText from "/src/components/examples/core-counter/core-counter.ts?raw";

<Code code={CounterTsText} lang="ts" title='core-counter.ts' />

([source](https://github.com/JLarky/lift-html/tree/main/docs/src/components/examples/core-counter/core-counter.ts))

## Explanation

This is an example of HTML Web Component patterns and doesn't use anything for reactivity. Initial component markup is generated by the server, then once client side implementation of custom element is loaded then `disabled` attribute is removed and click handler is added to the button. See also versions using [@lift-html/solid](/examples/solid-counter/) and [vanilla JavaScript](/examples/vanilla-counter/).
